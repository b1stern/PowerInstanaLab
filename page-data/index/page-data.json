The lab will focus on a few key areas including the installation and configuration of Agents, learning administrative capabilities, and how to diagnose problems with Instana.  Key sections of the lab include: \n\n1) In the first portion of the lab, students will instrument kubernetes and an AIX LPAR\n\n2) Next, students will explore the monitoring capabilities of Instana in relation to Power Systems\n\n3) In the 3rd section of the lab, students will perform a diagnostic scenario in the hybrid application\n\n4) Finally, in the 4th section students will learn how to perform administrative tasks.\n\nAfter completing the Login section, use the other links to go directly to one of the lab exercises.\n\n## Key Credentials and Configuration information\nWhen performing the lab, there are a few key pieces of information that you'll need to perform the lab.  For example, the username and password to log into the Instana user interface.  Those credentials and other configuration information is stored in a Box Note named **Instana Lab Information.boxnote**.  \n\nYou can navigate to this boxnote by going into the top level box folder.  Then, select the **Instana & Turbonomic Docs** folder.  Within that folder, you will find the boxnote.\n\n\n## Logging into the Environment\n\n  For the lab, you will be using the following Instana environment.  Open your browser and login to https://instana-labs.instana.io/\n\n  Students will be logging in with user account apmdemo-2@yahoo.com.   The password is provided in the boxnote listed in the previous section.\n\n  As part of the lab, you will be using the AIX LPAR and OpenShift Cluster where you previously setup the Wordpress application and MariaDB.  \n\n  After successfully logging into the Instana environment, you should see the main landing page that includes a list of Websites & Mobile Applications, Applications, Platforms, Infrastructure, and Events.\n\n ![](images/landingPage.png) \n\n## Begin the Exercises\n\nYou are now ready to start performing the lab exercises.  You must complete the **Installation** section first.  After that, the sections can be done in any order.  For a new user of Instana, we recommend performing the **Explore Instana** section of the lab next. \n\nSelect **\"Installation\"** in the upper left corner or select the **\"Installing and Configuring Monitoring\"** tile below.\n\n\n<Row>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Installing and Configuring Monitoring\"\n    title=\"Install the Instana Monitoring Agent and Configure the Sensors\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Install\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/dynamicGraph.png)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Explorer Instana\"\n    title=\"Explore the Instana UI and Capabilities\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Explore\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/InstanaTopology.png)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Diagnose a Problem\"\n    title=\"Learn How Instana Can Help you Quickly Diagnose a Complex Problem\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Diagnose\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/instanaEvents.png)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Administer Instana\"\n    title=\"Learn How to Perform Administrative Tasks in Instana\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Administration\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/infrastructure.png)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n***\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"b5f18c4d1ed48d723cbb40b1ef6f6ec2","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":304},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hybrid Cloud Tech Academy Instana Lab","description":"Education on Using Instana in a Power Systems environment"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"--- \ntitle: Hybrid Cloud Tech Academy Instana Lab \ndescription: Education on Using Instana in a Power Systems environment\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis lab is intended to educate on how to use Instana to monitor a Power Systems environment.
