Then, select the **\"Quote of the Day\"** application. \n\nNote, you can't use the application that you just installed for Analytics based threshold because\nthere isn't enough historical data.\n![](images/applicationsQOTD.png)\n\n\nClick on **\"Add Smart Alert\"** in the lower right corner.\n\n![](images/smartAlert.png)\n\n\nThere is a simple and an advanced mode.  We'll be using the advanced mode which allows you to see all of the capabilities.\n\nIn the upper right corner of the dialog, select **\"Switch to Advanced Mode\"**\n![](images/advanced.png)\n\nIn the upper left corner, you'll see that there are 5 different types of **Smart Alerts**\n- Slow Calls\n- Erroneous Calls\n- HTTP Status Codes\n- Throughput\n\nLeave the default of **\"Slow Calls\"**\n![](images/slowCalls.png)\n\nScroll down.  You'll see that there are number of options to determine which calls you want to analyze.  \n- You can analyze the calls for this application or you can analyze specific services or endpoints.\n- You can analyze **Inbound Calls** or **All Calls**\n- You can include **Internal Calls**\n- You can include **Synthetic Calls**\n\nLeave the default settings.\n\nScroll down further until you see the widgets show in the screen capture below.\n![](images/options2.png)\n\nYou'll notice that there are a variety of options including:\n- The ability to change the percentile that is used for the evaluation\n- The type of seasonality (static, daily, or weekly)\n- whether you want to view the last 24 hours or 7 days of historical data\n- Sensitivity.\n\nTry out some of the options.  In particular, move the slider for sensitivity.  Notice that when you set it to higher sensitivity, the number of red triangles show on the screen will change.\nThese red triangles indicate when thresholds would trigger if you had chosen that setting.\n![](images/sensitivity.png)\n\nChoose an appropriate value for the sensitivity.  You don't want to receive a lot of alert by setting the sensitivity too high.  Usually, if you see more than 1 or two alerts per day,\nthe sensitivity is probably too high.  But, it depends on the historical data that you're looking at and the mission criticality of the application.\n\nScroll down further.\n![](images/options3.png)\n\nYou'll see that there are options for persistence over time.  This ensures that the conditions trigger for a reasonable length of time before an alert is raised.  \n\nThere is also an option to select an **\"Alert Channel\"**.  An **\"Alert Channel\"** is a way to notify people about the event via different channels such as e-mail, slack, Watson AIOPs, etc.\n\nSelect the **\"Select Alert Channels\"** option.  A dialog will open with a few different **Alert Channels**.  Select one or more channel.  For example, have the alerts sent to the SRE slack channel.\n\nClick on the **\"Create Alert Channel\"** link in the upper right corner.\n\nClick on the dropdown list for the **\"Alert Channel type\"**.\n![](images/selectChannels.png)\n\nYou will see a list of all of the **\"Channel\"** options.  You can setup Alert Channels to slack, e-mail, Watson AIOps, splunk, and more.  There is also a **\"Generic Webhook\"** option that allows you\nto integrate with a variety of 3rd party products that support webhooks.\n![](images/channelOptions.png)\n\n\nDon't bother saving your changes.  We just wanted to allow you to see your options for setting up **\"Smart Alerts\"** and **\"Alert Channels\"**\n\nClick the **\"Cancel\"** button at the bottom of the dialog.\n\nClick **\"Cancel\"** two more times to close the **\"Smart Alert\"** dialog.\n\n\n\n# Create a static threshold (Event)\nNow, let's examine how a more traditional threshold is created and used in conjunction with Alert Channels.\n\nOn the left side of the screen, select the **\"Settings\"** gear.\n![](images/events.png)\n\nThe Settings menu provides access to most of the administrative tasks within Instana.  You'll notice menus for Events, Alerts, Alert Channels, API Tokens, Users, Groups, Log Managemnet Integration, and more\n\nSelect **\"Events\"**\n\nOnce you click on **\"Events\"**, you will see a list of 300+ Events that are defined as out of the box thresholds within Instana.  If you want to filter the list, you can do that in a number of ways\nvia the drop down lists at the top of the page.\n![](images/filterEvents.png)\n\nNotice that you can filter based on the Event type, severity, entity type, state, or simply enter a keyword filter.\n\nLet's select **\"Entity Type\"**\n\nSelect the **\"Entity Type\"** dropdown list and type **\"IBM MQ\"** into the field.  You'll notice that a few different options show up. Each of the options is an Entity Type.  You can filter \non the Events related to the IBM MQ Queue Manager, Queue, Channel, etc.\n\nSelect **\"IBM MQ Queue Manager\"** from the dropdown list.\n![](images/qmEvents.png)\n\nThis will filter the Events to the list of Events that are written against the IBM MQ Queue Manager entity type.  There are several out of the box threshold Events that will detect things like\nchannel initiator status, queue manager status, publish/subscribe engine status, and more.\n\nLet's create a new Event.\n\nAt the top of the screen, select the **\"+ New Event\"** link.\n![](images/newEvent.png)\n\nFill in the following information for you new Event:\n- Give your Event a name.  Use your **student name** when creating the Event as seen below.\n- Enter a description for the Event\n- Select a severity (Warning or critical)\n- Select the option of whether you want your Event to get correlated into Incidents\n- Select a Grace Period.   \n![](images/newEvent1.png)\n\nThe Grace Period is a capability that allow you to avoid getting multiple alerts during flapping.  Let's say you are monitoring for high CPU utilization on a server.  If CPU utilization goes High, \nthen Low, then High over a short period of time, you typically only want to see **ONE** event.  By setting a \"Grace Period\" of something like 60 seconds, you would only receive 1 Event during that interval.\n\nNow, scroll down a little further and fill in the remaining options.\n\nIn the **\"Condition\"** section, select the dropdown and choose **\"Built-in Metrics\"**.  Most of your thresholds will be written against these **Built-in Metrics**.  \n![](images/newEvent2.png)\n\nThe choice of \"Custom metrics\" would only apply to custom metrics that are being fed into Instana.  The \"System Rules\" are a specialized set of rules for doing thing like detecting that an \nentity is **\"offline\"**.\n\nOnce you select **\"Built-in Metrics\"** another dropdown list will appear.  The new dropdown list is asking for the **\"Entity type\"** that you are going to write your threshold against.\n\nIn the **\"Entity type\"** dropdown, select **\"IBM MQ Queue\"**.  Notice that you can type in letters such as \"IBM MQ\" to filter the list.\n![](images/newEvent3.png)\n\nAfter specifying an **\"Entity type\"**, a new dropdown appears with a list of available **\"Metrics\"**.  Select the **\"Metric\"** dropdown and choose **\"Depth > Queue Depth Percentage\"**.\n![](images/newEvent4.png)\n\nAfter making your select, some new dropdowns appear on the screen looking for the following information:\n- Time Window:  This is the duration that you want to monitor and evaluate\n- Aggregation:  Since Instana is capture data at a high interval, you can use Min, Max, Avg, Sum as part of your evaluation.  \n- Operator: What type of evaluation do you want to do (>, < =, etc.)\n- Percentage - This field is actually different depending on the metric you are evaluating. In this case, you are evaluating a metric that is a percentage.\n\nIn the dropdowns, choose **\"60 s\"** for the time window, **\"max\"** for the Aggregation, **\">\"** for the Operator, and **\"90\"** for the Percentage.\n![](images/newEvent5.png)\n\n\n# Setup an Alert for the New Event\nNow that you have a new Event defined, you need to define and Alert.  Alerts are used to notify people and teams via various Alert Channels.  You previously\nreviewed the options for Alert Channels.  The Alerts will be sent to one or more Alert Channels that you select.\n\nSelect **\"Settings\"** on the left side navigation.  Then select **\"Alerts\"** \n![](images/alerts.png)\n\nClick on the **\"+ New Alert\"** link \n![](images/newAlert.png)\n\nGive the new **\"Alert\"** a name.  To ensure you can find your **\"Alert\"**, call it your **\"student name\"**\n\nSelect the dropdown labeled **\"Alert on Event(s)\"**\n![](images/alertOnEvents.png)\n\nYou will see that there are multiple options.  You can setup an Alert for a particular Entity Type.  For example, you might setup an Alert for all Oracle Database Events.\n\nIn your case, select **\"Alert on Event(s)\"**.  This option allows you to select a specific list of Events to forward to an Alert Channel(s).\n\nFurther down on the page, select the **\"Add Events\"** link.\n![](images/addEvent.png)\n\nInitially, you will see a list of ALL Events.\n\nLet's filter the list to just a specific **Entity Type**.   Select the **\"Entity Type\"** dropdown list and select **\"IBM MQ Queue\"**\n![](images/filterQueue.png)\n\nYou will now see a filtered list of Events related to IBM MQ Queues.   Find the Event with your **\"student name\"** and select the checkbox.   Then, select the **\"Add 1 Event\"** button at the bottom.\n![](images/chooseEvent.png)\n\nYou will now see the 1 selected Event listed.  Further down on the screen you will see a **\"Scope\"** section.  This determines which Entities this Alert will apply to.\n![](images/scope.png)\n\nSelect the **\"Apply on\"** dropdown list. You'll see that you can choose one of 3 options:\n- Application Perspective:  This option allows you to limit the scope of the alert to a specific application.\n- Selected Entities Only:  You use the dynamic focus queries to filter to a specific set of Entities\n- All Available Entities:  The Alert would apply to any Entity that triggered the Event threshold.\n\nSelect the **\"Selected Entities Only\"** option\n![](images/selectedEntities.png)\n\nA new widget will appear on the right side of the screen asking you to specify the **\"Dynamic Focus Query\"**\n\nIn the entry field, enter the name of the queue that is used for the **Quote of the Day** application.  Enter the following value:\n```sh\nentity.ibmmq.queue.name:CP4I.DEMO.API.Q\n```\n![](images/CP4I.DEMO.API.Q.png)\n\nNext, click on the **\"+ Add Alert Channels\"** link\n![](images/alertChannel.png)\n\nA dialog will open with a list of available **\"Alert Channels\"**.  Since this is an MQ related Event, select the **\"MQ Admins\"** Alert Channel.\n\nThen, click the **\"Add 1 Channel\"** button.\n![](images/selectChannel.png)\n\nScroll down to the bottom. You will see an optional section where you can add custom payloads by adding Key/Value pairs.  We're going to skip that section.\n\nFinally, click the **\"Create\"** button to save your Alert.\n![](images/saveAlert.png)\n\n\nYou have now completed the section of the lab on performing Administrative Tasks within Instana.  You have learned how to create a Smart Alert, a traditional Alert (Event), and learned \n\n\nAt this point, you have created an Event and an Alert for that Event.  The next time the custom **\"Event\"** that you created triggers, an **\"Alert\"** will be sent to the **\"MQ Admins\"** Alert Channel.  In this case, a slack notification will be posted to a slack channel being monitored by the MQ Admins.\n\n\nIf you haven't completed all of the sections, you can continue other portions of the lab.
