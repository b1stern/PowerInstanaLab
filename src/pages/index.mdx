## Introduction

This lab is intended to educate on how to use Instana to monitor a Power Systems environment.   The lab will focus on a few key areas including the installation and configuration of Agents, learning administrative capabilities, and how to diagnose problems with Instan.  Key sections of the lab include: 

1) In the first portion of the lab, students will instrument kubernetes and an AIX LPAR

2) Next, students will explore the monitoring capabilities of Instana in relation to Power Systems

3) In the 3rd section of the lab, students will perform a diagnostic scenario in the hybrid application

4) Finally, in the 4th section students will learn how to perform administrative tasks.

After completing the Login section, use the other links to go directly to one of the lab exercises.
