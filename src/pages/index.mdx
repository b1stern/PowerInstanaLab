## Introduction

This lab is intended to educate the IBM Power organization on Instana.   The lab will focus on a few key areas including the installation and configuration of Agents, learning administrative capabilities, and how to diagnose problems with Instan.  Key sections of the lab include: 

1) In the first portion of the lab, students will instrument kubernetes and an AIX LPAR

2) Next, students will explore the monitoring capabilities of Instana in relation to Power Systems

3) In the 3rd section of the lab, students will perform a diagnostic scenario in the hybrid application

4) Finally, in the 4th section students will learn how to perform administrative tasks.

After completing the Login section, use the other links to go directly to one of the lab exercises.


When you first login to the Soleil virtual machines, a chrome browser will be open with multiple tabs.  The first tab will be this lab guide.  We recommend that you use
the lab guide within the virtual machine so that you can easily copy and past text into the terminal windows.

## Logging into the Environment

  For the lab, you will be using the following Instana environment.  Open your browser and login to https://instana-labs.instana.io/

  Students will be logging in with user account apmdemo-1@yahoo.com.   The password will be provided separately to the students at the time of the lab.

  As part of the lab, you will be using the AIX LPAR and OpenShift Cluster where you previously setup the Wordpress application and MariaDB.  

  After successfully logging into the Instana environment, you should see the main landing page that includes a list of Websites & Mobile Applications, Applications, Platforms, Infrastructure, and Events.
