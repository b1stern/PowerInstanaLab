The lab will focus on a few key areas including the installation and configuration of Agents, learning administrative capabilities, and how to diagnose problems with Instan.  Key sections of the lab include: \n\n1) In the first portion of the lab, students will instrument kubernetes and an AIX LPAR\n\n2) Next, students will explore the monitoring capabilities of Instana in relation to Power Systems\n\n3) In the 3rd section of the lab, students will perform a diagnostic scenario in the hybrid application\n\n4) Finally, in the 4th section students will learn how to perform administrative tasks.\n\nAfter completing the Login section, use the other links to go directly to one of the lab exercises.\n\n\nWhen you first login to the Soleil virtual machines, a chrome browser will be open with multiple tabs.  The first tab will be this lab guide.  We recommend that you use\nthe lab guide within the virtual machine so that you can easily copy and past text into the terminal windows.\n\n## Logging into the Environment\n\n  For the lab, you will be using the following Instana environment.  Open your browser and login to https://instana-labs.instana.io/\n\n  Students will be logging in with user account apmdemo-1@yahoo.com.   The password will be provided separately to the students at the time of the lab.\n\n  As part of the lab, you will be using the AIX LPAR and OpenShift Cluster where you previously setup the Wordpress application and MariaDB.  \n\n  After successfully logging into the Instana environment, you should see the main landing page that includes a list of Websites & Mobile Applications, Applications, Platforms, Infrastructure, and Events.\n\n ![](images/landingPage.png) \n\n## Begin the Exercises\n\nYou are now ready to start performing the lab exercises.  You must complete the Installation section first.  After that, the sections can be done in any order.  For a new user of Instana, we recommend \nperforming the **Explore Instana** section of the lab next.  If you are already familiar with Instana, you can select any other section of the lab.\n\nSelect **\"Installation\"** in the upper left corner or select the **\"Installing and Configuring Monitoring\"** tile below.\n\n\n<Row>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Installing and Configuring Monitoring\"\n    title=\"Install the Instana Monitoring Agent and Configure the Sensors\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Install\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/dynamicGraph.png)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Explorer Instana\"\n    title=\"Explore the Instana UI and Capabilities\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Explore\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/InstanaTopology.png)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Diagnose a Problem\"\n    title=\"Learn How Instana Can Help you Quickly Diagnose a Complex Problem\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Diagnose\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/instanaEvents.png)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Administer Instana\"\n    title=\"Learn How to Perform Administrative Tasks in Instana\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Administration\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/infrastructure.png)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n***\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"e3733b4d96deb42d73d4baf585a914f2","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":258},"frontmatter":{"title":"Power SKO Instana Lab","description":"Instana Education for the IBM Power Organization"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"--- \ntitle: Power SKO Instana Lab \ndescription: Instana Education for the IBM Power Organization\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis lab is intended to educate the IBM Power organization on Instana.
