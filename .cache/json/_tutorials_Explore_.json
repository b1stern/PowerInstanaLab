Use the following URL:  https://instana-labs.instana.io/\nLogin as apmdemo-1@yahoo.com and the password provided by your instructor.\n\n## 2-1: Explore PowerVM Monitoring\nIn this section of the lab, we'll explore how Instana can be used to monitor the PowerVM infrastructure.  This includes monitoring AIX LPARs, Linux LPARs, IBM i LPARs and the Power infrastructure via the HMC.\n\nSelect **Infrastructure** on the left size of the Instana UI.\n  ![](images/kubernetes.png)\n\nIn the Infrastructure view, you will notice that there are several key Power resources.  You'll see a Zone named **IBM i** that contains an IBM i LPAR that is running DB2.  You will also see a zone named **pLinux** that contains a Linux LPAR running on Power.  You should also see the nodes that makeup your OCP Cluster and your AIX LPAR with the Zone names that you specified during the installation.\n\nExplore the Host Agents on IBM i, AIX, and Linux on Power by selecting the Node and then selecting the **Open Dashboard** button.\n  ![](images/IBMi.png)\n\nYou will notice that AIX and Linux on Power are nearly identical to Linux on x86.  The configuration details on the left side are slightly different, but most Host metrics are the same.  When you look at the IBM i Host Agent, you'll notice quite a few differences.  This Host Agent is more extensive and includes information such as running **jobs**, **auxiliary storage pools**, **spinning disks**, **queues** and more.\n\nNext, explore the monitoring data being gathered via the HMC sensor.  On the left size of the navigation, select **Platform** and then select **IBM Power**\n  ![](images/HMC.png)\n\nYou will see a list of HMC's that are being monitored.  In this environment, there is only one HMC.  You can see a summary of what the HMC is managing.  In this case, 3 physical systems and 46 partitions.   Notice that there is also a 2nd tab where you can navigate directly to the **Systems** that are being managed by the HMC.\n  ![](images/HMC2.png)\n\nSelect the blue link to drill into the HMC.\n\nYou will now see a list of the 3 systems that are being managed by this HMC and a summary of the systems.\n  ![](images/systems.png)\n\nClick on the blue link for the last server.  This system is the most interesting because it has the most LPARs.\n\nYou should now see a detailed page showing the configuration and performance of this Power server.  Explore the metrics on the page.  Notice that there are multiple tabs at the top of the screen.  Explore the **Logical Partition** and **Virtual I/O Server** tabs.  \n  ![](images/system.png)\n\nOn the Logical Partition screens, notice that there are multiple tabs at the of the screen for **Summary**, **Network**, and **Storage**.  You'll see that key LPAR information such as the entitled processor information and whether the LPAR is capped or uncapped is captured.\n\nThe **Virtual I/O Server** is one of the most important things to examine.  If the Virtual I/O Server is low on I/O resources, it can impact the performance of the LPARs that use the VIOS.  Drill into one of the Virtual I/O Servers and examine the data on the **Network** and **Storage** tabs.  You'll see key information including the **Shared Ethernet Adapters**, **SR-IOV**, **Fibre Channel Adapters**, **Shared Storage Pools**, and more.\n  ![](images/VIOS.png)\n\n***\n\n## 2-2: Explore OpenShift on Power\n\nIn this section of the lab, we'll focus on monitoring of the OpenShift infrastructure when the OCP is running on Power.  What's important to understand is that there are no Power specific.  The only thing you will notice that is different between x86, Power, and Z is on the Details tab of the Nodes.  On that screen, you can see the platform details.\n  ![](images/kube.png)\n\nOpen the browser for the Instana user interface.\n\nOn the left navigation, select **Platforms** and then **Kubernetes**\n  ![](images/kubernetes2.png)\n\nYou will see a list of kubernetes clusters.   Look for the Cluster with your name.  If you don't see your name, you may need to wait a couple of minutes.\n  ![](images/clusters.png)\n\nIf you don't see your student name after a couple of minutes, we need to troubleshoot the Instana Agent.  From a terminal window, issue the following command:\n```sh\noc get pods -n instana-agent\n```\n\nCheck to make sure that all pods are running.\n\nIf all pods are running, we need examine the logs of one of the pods.\n\nType:  \n```sh\noc logs POD_NAME -c instana-agent -n instana-agent\n```\nwhere **POD_NAME** is one of the pods listed in the previous command.\n\nAssuming that your cluster name shows up properly, click on the link for your student name.\n\nYou should see a screen similar to the one below where you can see overall utilization of the kubernetes cluster.\n  ![](images/cluster.png)\n\nSelect some of the other tabs to explore the kubernetes monitoring.  We recommend you look at the Events, Nodes, and Pods tabs.  When you select the pods tab, you will see a list of all pods running within the cluster.\n\nIn the upper right corner, add your name into the search widget.  You'll notice that it will filter the list to the pods related to the Quote of the Day application.\n  ![](images/pods.png)\n\nClick on one of the links on the left side and drill into the pod utilization details.\n\n\n***\n\n### 2-3: Explore the Quote of the Day Application\n\nNavigate to the **Applications** portion of Instana where we'll examine some of the key application related information that is gathered.\n  ![](images/applications2.png)\n\nIn the upper right corner, set the time interval so that you are viewing the **Last hour** of data.\n\nSelect the **Quote of the Day** application\n  ![](images/QOTD.png)\n\nOn this page you can see the **Golden Signals**.  This includes the transaction volumes, the number of erroneous calls, latency, as well as the top services that make up the application.\n\nYou'll notice that there is a period of time where you can see an increase in the number of **Erroneous Calls**.  At the same time interval, there is an increase in **Latency**.  Later, we'll investigate these conditions in a diagnostic scenario.\n\n\nYou'll notice a number of tabs across the top of the screen.  Explore these tabs.  In particular, let's take a look at the **\"Depedencies\"** tab.\n  ![](images/dependencies2.png)\n\nOn the dependencies tab, you'll see a full topology of the application services.  This topology is discovered automatically.  You can see transactions flowing between\nthe different nodes in the topology.   Most of these services are node.js based cloud-native services. The **\"acemq.tivlab.raleigh.ibm.com-BK1:EG2\"** is the ACE \nintegration node named BK1 and Integration Server named EG2.   The QM1 node in the topology is the MQ Queue Manager named **\"QM1\"**.  **apim-demo-gw-gateway-cp4i-apic.apps.jarjar.coc-ibm.com** is a DataPower API Gateway. \n\nFrom an application perspective, **qotd-web** calls the **qotd-engraving** service which in turn makes an API call to the DataPower API Gateway.  The **API Gateway** makes an API call to an **ACE flow** which then calls **MQ** and puts a message on a queue.\n\nFlyover a few of services. You'll notice that you can see a summary of the latency and erroneous calls for each service.\n  ![](images/flyover.png) \n\nClick on the **\"QM1\"** node.  Notice that there are 3 options that would allow you to navigate to the MQ dashboard, the transaction Flow within MQ, or analyze the transaction\ncalls through MQ.\n\nClick on the **Error Messages** tab and you'll see any error that has occurred within the **Last hour** of data that you are showing on the screen.\n  ![](images/errors.png) \n\nClick on **\"Upstream/Downsteam\"** near the top of the page.  This will allow you to see a list of Upstream and Downstream services for the application.\n  ![](images/upstreamDownstream.png)\n\n\nClick on **\"Stack\"** where you can view the Application, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure stack that makes up the application.\n  ![](images/stack.png)\n\n\nAll of this contextual and relationship data helps you analyze and debug you applications to get to root cause as quickly as possible.  In addition, our built \nanalytics uses this data to automatically group multiple related **\"Events\"** into a single **\"Incident\"** for diagnosis.\n\nClose the **Stack** dialog by either clicking on the **Stack** button or somewhere else on the background of the Instana GUI.\n\nNote:  It is also possible to click on the **Analyze Calls** button on the page in order to analyze individual transactions that are flowing through the application.  We'll skip that step for now and will Analyze calls as part of a diagnostic scenario later in the lab.\n  ![](images/analyzeCalls2.png)\n\n***\n\n## 2-4: Unbounded Analytics\nInstana stores data data in datastores like Cassandra, Elasticsearch, and Clickhouse in such a way that it easy to apply **unbounded analytics** to the data and search for key patterns and characteristics.   Let's explore how you can use **unbounded analytics**\n\nOn the left side, select **Analytics**\n  ![](images/analytics.png)\n\nAt the top of the screen, you'll see that there is a dropdown called **Applications -> Calls**.  If you select the dropdown, you'll notice that there are several options available to analyze Application **Calls**, **Traces**, **Websites**, **Mobile Apps**, **Infrastructure** metrics, and **Profiles**.  For this lab, we'll focus on the default selection of **Application Calls**.  In your spare time, feel free to Analyze other types of data.\n  ![](images/calls.png)\n\nBy default, you will see a list of **all** application calls.   **Unbounded analytics** provides and opportunity to answer some questions that you might have able the application calls.   Let's look at a scenario that a DBA might be interested in.   A DBA might want to see which SQL queries are taking the longest to run.  This is easy to achieve with **unbounded analytics**.\n\nFirst, we need to filter the queries to just the database calls.  For this exercise, we'll select all database calls, but we could easily filter further to specific types of databases or specific applications.  On the left side of the screen, select **Type** and then select the **Database** checkbox.  This will filter the calls to just the **Database** calls.\n  ![](images/database.png) \n\nNext, click on the **Add group** button near the top of the page.\n  ![](images/group.png) \n\nA drop down list will open with a list of the types of calls.  In the seach bar, type **\"statement\"** and then select **Database -> Statement**.\n  ![](images/statement.png) \n\nThis will group all of the statements to the unique SQL statements that have been executed within the last hour.  By default, these are sorted based on the number of calls.\n\nFinally, let's sort these statements based on **latency**.\n\nOn the middle right of the screen, select **Calls (sum)** and then choose **Latency (mean)** from the dropdown list.\n  ![](images/sortLatency.png)\n\nYou can now see a list of the unique SQL statements sorted by the mean latency for that particular SQL statement.\n  ![](images/sortedLatency.png)  \n\nIf desired, you can expand one of the arrow on the right side to see the individual SQL calls so that you can see whether all calls are slow or whether there are outliers.\n\nAnd, you can select an individual call and Analyze the transaction in the context of the end-to-end application transaction.\n\n***\n\n## 2-5: Summary\n\nIn this exercise you have explored some of the key capabilities within Instana.  You explored PowerVM monitoring. You explored kubernetes monitoring. You explored the application monitoring details.  And, you explored how you can use unbounded analytics to glean insights.\n\n\nTo continue other portions of the lab, select one of the lab exercises in the upper left corner or select one of the images below.\n\n***\n\n<Row>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Diagnose a Problem\"\n    title=\"Learn How Instana Can Help you Quickly Diagnose a Complex Problem\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Diagnose\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/instanaEvents.png)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Administer Instana\"\n    title=\"Learn How to Perform Administrative Tasks in Instana\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Administration\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/infrastructure2.png)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"3f2995e2a95a3b3d35ee8fc5c5d9af94","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":269},"frontmatter":{"title":"Section 2 - Explore Instana and the Quote of the Day Application","description":null},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Section 2 - Explore Instana and the Quote of the Day Application\ndescription:\n---\n\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>2-1: Explore PowerVM Monitoring</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>2-2: Explore kubernetes</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>2-3: Exploring the Quote of the Day Application</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>2-4: Unbounded Analytics</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>2-5: Summary</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n***\n\nIn this portion of the lab, you will explore some key Instana capabilities including monitoring of PowerVM, kubernetes, monitoring of applications, and monitoring of infrastructure.\n\nIf you haven't already done so, login to the Instana user interface via a browser.
